Michigan is one of eight states currently banning race-based admissions.  The inconsistency puzzles Justice Sam Alito, too, as he made clear in his dissenting opinion.\n \nBut Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing in his majority opinion, said that the University of Texas had met its burden of showing its admissions policy was \"narrowly tailored\" (?) and that such policy was consistent with equal protection.   Sadly, we've gotten so used to policies that fight racism with more racism that we can actually look at \"race conscious\" admissions policies as consistent with equal protection.\n \nFor more details on the affirmative action decision, click here.",

And they apparently got rid of him because he was doing a bad job! Imagine what they would have given him if he was doing a good job.\n\nThis is a company that could afford to pay its new CEO more than $14 million in total compensation last year.\n\nThis is a company which made a profit of more than $7 billion last year.\n\nThis is a company that received $6 billion in defense contracts last year from the taxpayers of this country.\n\nThis is a company that in 2009 received $121 million in federal tax credits designed specifically to keep green manufacturing jobs in the United States.\n\nAnd this is a company that has received more than $58 million in corporate welfare from the Export-Import Bank. That is unacceptable.\n\nThe greed of United Technologies is almost unbelievable. You can't make this stuff up. They have no shame.\n\nToday, we need to send a very loud and very clear message to the CEO of United Technologies: Stop the greed. Stop destroying the middle class in America. Respect your workers.
