Through all my good times, hard times, failures and successes - music has always help shape and define every key moment in my life. As it does with all of us. \nAnd as is the case with our history. Every era, every revolution, every triumphant moment and every heartbreak has a distinct sound and song that can transport us right back to that moment in time.\n\nOur #SevenBucksProductions and #ShowofForce are proud to bring you a new CNN Original Series called #Soundtracks: SONGS THAT MADE HISTORY.\n\nWe're taking you on an extraordinary journey through history using the music that defined our country's biggest moments.\n\nWe delivered the pilot to CNN, which included iconic artists from Billy Joel, to Lee Greenwood to Patti LeBelle who all sat with us to speak on how their music defined and inspired our country post 9/11. Incredibly moving and inspiring pilot and many tears shed (not me of course, I'm too tough to cry). CNN immediately ordered an entire series.\n\nThis is a passion, heart and soul project for our Seven Bucks Productions and Show Of Force. I think we're making something very cool, high quality and special for you to enjoy. Coming soon.\n\n#SoundTracks #MusicDefinesHistory #MusicDefinesUsAll",
