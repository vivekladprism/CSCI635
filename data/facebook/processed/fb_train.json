How do you define Indian cinema? Do you feel it is progressed with times..\n\nANS//\nIndian Cinema is poetic justice in 3 hours ! You and I may never get that in a lifetime \u2013 perhaps several life times. Yes indeed it has progressed with time. It would never have lasted for more than a 100 years if it did not \u2026\n4. Are you critical of your films?\n\nANS//\nYes ..\n5. You are a legend sir and inspire today's youngsters what is your inspiration of life and role model?\n\nANS// \nI am no legend and certainly cannot be looked upon as an inspiration for youngster's. I consider myself fortunate to be in a profession that gives me the opportunity to express to the best of my limited ability, what is desired of me by writers and makers. Each generation that has come after me and indeed that has been there before me are my inspiration. I look up to them and have the greatest admiration for them ..\n6. What are your upcoming projects and what kind of roles you would like prefer in near future?\n\nANS//\nI have 'PINK' produced by Shoojit Sarkar and directed by Tony, Anirudh Roy .. there is one with YRF and Victor as director .. and a few more on the anvil, which have to fructify.

Any sweet memories with south cinema industry you would like to share ?\n\nANS//\nI have spent a great amount of time in the region and have very fond memories with Directors Artists and others that contribute to the Southern Film Industry.

My deep respect to all that contribute towards the film industry in the Southern region \u2026\n10.Would u like to learn telugu language and if good role is offered to u in telugu cinema will u go for it?\n\nANS//\nYes I would .. I did speak a few words in Telugu in one of my films, and have worked in a Telugu film too. If there is something that excites me I would certainly want to work in a Telugu film\n11. What is your opinion on telugu cinema?\n\nANS//\nI do believe that the largest number of films made in India are from the South and that Telugu cinema has a larger turn over than the much talked about Hindi cinema. This is of course my very limited information, and needs verification of course \u2026\n12..Sir if u  can share your some lovely  and inspiration experience of your childhood with ur father which u still follow and make sure that your children also follow that?\n\nANS//\nHe taught me a lot but his one most important teaching was .. \n\" Man ka ho toh achcha \u2013 Na  toh zyaada achcha\" .. \nmeaning :\nIf things happen the way you want it, good. But if they do not, then even better. Why better ..? because then they are then happening according to the wish of the Almighty and He shall always think of your betterment.\n13.

As you are very active in social media ?\n\nANS//\nSocial networking has given me the opportunity to connect with my well wishers. It is wonderful to be able to have conversation or discussion or debate with all of them that we could never reach. They are all important people, for they are the ones that give us the honor and privilege of being who we are. We are in a position of celebrity, because of them. It is wonderful to know what they think \u2013 both complimentary and not so complimentary !\n16.As we have seen you taking lot of initiative to save girl child and education, beyond that on any other section you think needs to take care of by government and by the common man?\n\nANS//\nI work for eradication of Polio as UN Ambassador and have successfully after 8 years made India Polio free .. I campaign for the Girl Child and 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', for TB, for Hepatitis B, for Save the Tiger, 'Swatch Bharat' and several other social causes .. I am to work for the Traffic Police department, for Khadi ..\n17.Sir anytime u got a thought in your life that if you are not a actor, may be in other field which inspire you the most?\n\nANS//\nI started my work career as an executive in a Company in Kolkata. After coming to films I do not know of what else I can do. \n19. Whenever you are in Hyderabad , what excites you most ,it's food ,friends or going around different places ?\n\nANS//\nThe food and friends ..\n\nQUESTIONS FROM THE TELEGRAPH KOLKATTA SPECIAL\n1. After Piku, the shoot for Te3n took you back to Kolkata. What is it about the city that makes it so special on celluloid?\nANS//\nThe people. They are passionate and warm and welcoming and filled with great emotion and  knowledge. Having spent almost 8 years working in Kolkata as an executive, it is a city that has remained close to me. On celluloid - well celluloid is over and extinct now, its all digital - Kolkata has some remarkable history and culture around and about it, most of it still unexploited and that makes the region rich for movie making. Also the authorities have always given us great support cooperation and help in providing us the right atmosphere to work in.\n2. Of all the times you've shot in Kolkata, this there any particular memory that stands out?\nANS//\nEach moment that has been spent in Kolkata during the shooting of my films has been filled with great stories and wonderful memories. They have all been happy, emotional and enjoyable.\n3. Is there any particular memory from the shoot of Te3n that has stayed with you?\nANS//\nThe visit to the forests around Shantiniketan and indeed Shantiniketan itself. The trip was sublime. Then some portions of Kolkata that I had never seen \u2013 in particular North Kolkata and the old structures and buildings and their preservation. \n\n4. Do you have any must-dos when you visit Kolkata? (people to meet or food from specific places you want to sample?)\nANS//\nPeople .. my old bosses and friends that I have maintained a connect with during my times of the 60's when I worked there. My eating habits are now limited and very mundane, but I did \n cherish the 'puchka' outside Victoria Memorial, the 'karti kebab' of Nizams, the Chinese food at Waldorf, the prawn cocktail at Skyroom and of course the delicious and varied sweetmeats at every corner of the city.\n5. What was Ribhu's brief for playing John Biswas?\nANS//\nTo remain as simple and unaffected as possible. And to keep away from too much Bengali because I had already done that in 'PIKU' .. recently released. \n6. The way Ribhu imagined this character required you to shave your beard after a very long time. Was it an easy decision for you to shave?\nANS//\nNo not really .. but then one has to follow the diktat of the director and the script.\n7. This film pairs you along with Nawazuddin for the first time. What is your impression of him as a co-star?\nANS//\nNawaz is an exceptional talent and it has been a joy to work with him. It has been a learning for me.\n8. After all these years, is there anything you wouldn't do for a role?\nANS//\nI am uncomfortable with kissing and sex scenes. I avoid that. As also the use of expletives and abusive language.\n9. This is your second consecutive thriller. Are there genres you enjoy doing more than others?\nANS//\nNot really. I do whatever comes to me. At this age and time I cannot be a chooser. I am fortunate to be getting any work at all.\n10. Yesterday you participated in a lovely event that attempted to take the audience behind the scenes of making this film. You mentioned the lack of such documentation in the past. Hypothetically, what films or what personalities would you have liked to watch/hear/read more about?\nANS//\nAll the greats of cinema. From Bengal, that has had such a rich contribution \u2013 Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwick Ghatak and the many artists, Chabi Biswas, Uttam Kumar and so many others. From the Hindi film industry the greats like Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt, K Asif, Mehboob, artists like Dilip Kumar and others. From the South \u2013 Sivaji Ganesan, MGR, NTR, Akkineni Nageshwar Rao and endless talents.\n11. You are re-teaming with directors like Shoojit, Ramu, Bejoy, Gaurang. Is easier to work with directors you have worked before. \nANS//\nThere is a level of comfort, of understanding each other. But they too were new and first time directors at some point of time, so you adjust.\n12. Will we see you back on television any time soon?\nANS//\nPerhaps next year ..\n13. Aishwarya, Abhishek and you have had releases pretty much back-to-back. It must have been a crazy time in the Bachchan household?\nANS//\nNot really. We are all in the business and we understand what it means, so there is no issue there.\n14. A few years ago in an interview you had told me that a new skill you wanted to learn was playing the piano. How is that going?\nANS//\nNot just the piano but also the sitar and the sarod and classical singing. I am desperate to learn them but am just not getting the time or the people to push me into a learning routine .. I guess it will happen sometime ..\n\nQUESTIONS FROM FILMFARE\n\n1. Every performance of yours invites accolades. As an actor how much emphasis do you give to both appreciation and criticism?\n\nANS//\nANS//\nCriticism is important and valuable. It shows you a mirror that you are unable to see. It teaches and I learn from it. Appreciation is humbling, but not something that one should get too overawed by I feel.\n\n2. When was the last time you received criticism, which helped you as an artiste, as a performer?\nANS//\nEach film teaches, and the critics bring out some aspect of the film or the performance which enhances your capacity to learn and understand. Sometimes it is difficult to mark a mistake yourself, until it is shown by another. That is something that should be valued. It happens in all the creative work that we do. And it is most essential.\n3. Which was the last performance you watched (of another actor) that left you deeply impressed?\nANS//\nRanveer Singh in 'Bajirao Mastani' and Randeep Hooda in 'Sarabjit' \u2026\n4. What's the motivation that makes you look forward to going on the set?\nANS//\nThe continuity of another job ..\n5. Would you agree that being happy at work is the best therapy after all?\nANS//\nOh yes .. those moments should be the happiest, else stop working ! When the camera rolls and the director shouts 'action', it is not a director, but a therapist healing your mind and body.\n6. TE3N took you back to Kolkata. What made it memorable this time?\nANS//\nEach visit to Kolkata is most memorable and enjoyable and nostalgic and filled with passion. The people and the city do this to you.\n7. What was the challenge of playing a grandfather wanting to avenge the murder of his granddaughter?\nANS//\nJohn Biswas, the character that I play is an Anglo-Bengali, is a lower middle class ordinary old man, weak physically and emotionally too. His effort is not to avenge so much, but to discover the truth and a confession of the episode and incident. Its one of the most difficult aspects of cinema to remain simple. Ribhu and Sujoy wanted that from me and I hope we have managed to achieve that.\n8. Would you say playing older characters is far more liberating than playing a 'hero' was in the '70s \u2013 '90s, where one had to adhere to mass expectations? Are you enjoying this phase?\nANS//\nAge does allow a greater variety yes .. and therefore is more challenging at times. But let us not overlook those early years as well. They were tough and difficult too. At this phase of my career one does get the benefit of a sublime liberation, of lesser responsibility for the box office return, not because the box office does not have meaning, but the return is not in the range of the bigger stars of the firmament. Our returns will not be in the massive range of the others, so we strive to achieve within our limited means \u2026\n9. TE3N has brought you again with Vidya Balan. What makes it special to face the camera with her?\nANS//\nShe is a celebrated and gifted artist and an exceptional co artist. It has been wonderful always to be in her company, both socially and professionally.\n10. Nawazuddin Siddiqui \u2013 one of the finest talents we have\u2026 What was that special quality that you noticed about him as an artiste?\nANS//\nThe effortless ease of his demeanor in front of the camera. That to me as an artist is difficult to achieve, but Nawaz does it with such aplomb. Just watching him do that is a great learning.\n11. Most of your younger co-actors tend to be your fans\u2026 Is it difficult breaking the ice with them?\nANS//\n\nThat is a misconception, for, I am their greatest fan. This generation has some of the most brilliant talents that I have ever seen. For me it is a fan moment to be in their midst. \n12. Aniruddha Roy's Pink is said to revolve around a father-daughter relationship? Its not quite clear. Can you please elaborate and explain the title?\nANS//\nNo it is not a Father-daughter relationship, but a relationship with 3 girls who could have been his daughter's age. It is a film on women empowerment and that is why it is called PINK..\n13. A father-daughter relationship is said to be the tenderest bond. Do you agree?\nANS//\nThe tenderest and the most emotional .. \n14. There are a lot of special girls in your life\u2026 Shweta, Aishwarya, Aaradhya and Navya\u2026 what do daughters lend to a home?\nANS//\nThe aroma of ethics .. the hush of beauty .. and the smiles of their presence ..\n\n15. \n16. Abhishek has often stated that he's your fan and your buddy apart from being your son. What makes him a special person?\nANS//\nThat he is my friend first and a son later ..\n\n17. You've admirably adapted to every ear, with every director\u2026 Do you sometimes wish you could turn back the hands of time?\nANS//\nTurn back the hands of time and do what ? The past is over, look upon it with nostalgia, its teaching, its pleasant memory and move on to the tomorrow, with expectation of betterment.\n18. Fame, popularity, prosperity\u2026 are all offshoots of being in showbiz. But what is it that\n19. \n20. \n21. \n you as an actor really crave for?\n\nANS//\nAnother job ..\n\n22. Audiences truly enjoyed your candid act with Jayaji in Ki & Ka. Did you enjoy it too while doing it? Do you agree that a woman invariably ends up sacrificing more in a marriage?\nANS//\nYes I enjoyed doing it and yes I do feel that the woman ends up sacrificing more. She suddenly realizes one fine day that she has to shift from the home she was born and brought up in, to another which shall now onwards be her new home. She undergoes a change in her surname, she now brings new life to the world and nurtures them, brings them up keeping all other chores aside, builds a home for them, much like her own parents did for her when she was born. All this needs respect and admiration.  \n23. Jayaji and you have enjoyed a long innings together\u2026 What makes her a special friend, a special partner?\nANS//\nShe makes a home, that you long to come back to ..",
